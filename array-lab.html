                    <p>Write a C-program, which reads five English words in the 
                        following order, an article (A/An/The), a noun, a verb (in simple 
                        present or past tense), an article, and a noun. For any of these words, 
                        if you provide a digit as a string, it will consider the word as an empty 
                        string. The program forms an English sentence in another string by 
                        taking care of blank spaces in between and appending the punctuation 
                        symbol ‘full stop’ (.) at the end.<br> While converting, it would take care 
                        of converting any upper case alphabet to a lower case alphabet if it is 
                        not the first word of the sentence. <br>Similarly, it would convert a lower 
                        case alphabet of the first alphabet of the first word in the sentence to 
                        an upper case alphabet. Finally, it prints the sentence.<br>
                        <br>
                        For example:<br>
                        (i) Input: “the”, “Girl”, “reads”, “a”, “Book”. <br>
                         Output: “The girl reads a book.”<br>
                        <br>
                        (ii) Input: “5”, “they”, “Went”, “2”, “Home”.<br>
                         Output: “They went home.”<br>
                         <br>
                        Provide results for the following inputs:<br>
                        1. “A”, “man”, “asks”, “The”, “Person”.<br>
                        2. “0”, “Rahim”, “throws”, “the”, “football”.<br>
                        3. “the”, “dog”, “chases”, “the”, “cat”<br>

                        <br> Ex:<br> 
                         If A has 12, 3, 4, 11,12, 4, 13, 12, you should print 12, 3,

                    <p>A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same 
                        backward or forward<br>
                         Example, “madam”, “radar”, “abcddcba”,….<br>
                        Write a C program that will do the following in the order 
                        given: <br>
                        <br>
                         Reads in a string in a character array S using %s format 
                        in scanf<br>
                         Type the string with no space and end it with pressing 
                        Enter<br>
                         Assume that the size of the string (including the ‘\0’ at the 
                        end will not be more than 50 characters)<br>
                         Remember that for reading with %s, you give only the 
                        name of the character array in which you want to read, 
                        without any & in front Computes and prints the length of the string<br>
                         Length = number of characters in the string not counting the ‘\0’at 
                        the end<br>
                         Write a for loop to check the characters in the array S one by one 
                        till you get the character ‘\0’ <br>
                         Reads in an integer p<br>
                         Checks if the string S has any palindrome of length p or not<br>
                         If yes, print the palindrome part of the string only<br>
                         If there are more than one such palindrome, print any one<br>
                         Once you find such a palindrome, you should stop checking 
                        and break out of the loop (use break statement)<br>
                         If no, print a message<br>
                         Do NOT use any other array or write any functions even if you know 
                        it (50% penalty if any other array is used or any function is used)<br>
                         Hint: Start from each character in S from the start (one loop) and 
                        check if there is a palindrome of length p starting from it (another 
                        loop)<br>
                        Example: <br>
                        <br>
                         If S = “abccba” and p = 6, prints “abccba” (as S is itself a 
                        palindrome of length 6)<br>
                         If S = “abccba” and p = 4, prints “bccb” (as “bccb” is a 
                        palindrome of length 4 inside S)<br>
                         If S = “abccba” and p = 2, prints “cc” (as “cc” is a palindrome 
                        of length 2 inside S)<br>
                         If S = “abccba” and p = 3, prints “No palindrome of length 3 in 
                        S” (as there is no palindrome of length 3 inside S)<br>
                         If S = “abbcddc” and p = 4, prints any one of “abbc” or “cddc” 
                        (as both are palindromes of length 4 inside S). Which one 
                        you hit first will depend on the way you write your program.<br>
                         In all cases, once it finds a palindrome and prints it, it should 
                        not check for palindromes any more (break from for loop)</p>
