You should use fgets() call to read from the input file (not fscanf).<br> You can use any string library functions.
                        <br>
                        For example if the input file contains: iit-kgp 2021 Pabitra Mitra<br>
                        <br>
                        Output file should contain:<br>
                        IIT-KGP 2021<br>
                        <br>

                    <p>Consider a m x n 2-d matrix A of integers. It is given that elements in 
                        each row of the matrix are sorted in ascending order.<br> In this 
                        assignment, you will sort the elements of the array such that elements 
                        in each row are sorted in ascending order AND all elements in the 2nd
                        row are ≥ any element in the 1st row, all elements in the 3rd row are ≥ 
                        any element in the 2nd row, and so on.<br>
                         See example on next slide<br>
                         Obviously, this may move any element in the array from its current 
                        position to any other position. That is ok.<br>
                         The matrix elements will be given in a file (one row in each line), you 
                        will read the matrix from the file<br>
                         See text file infile.txt given containing the matrix in the example<br>
                         You will write the sorted matrix in another file outfile.txt row by row 
                        (one row per line)<br>
                        <br>
                        For example, if A is<br>
                        1 5 10 12<br>
                        4 6 7 9<br>
                        1 5 8 10<br>
                        then after sorting, A is modified to<br>
                        1 1 4 5<br>
                        5 6 7 8<br>
                        9 10 10 12<br>
                        <br>
                         Write a C function void SortMatrix(…) that takes as parameter a 
                        n x m 2-d array (n, m < 10) representing a matrix, and sorts the 
                        matrix in the form as described. Add appropriate parameters to 
                        the function for this.<br>
                         You can use one additional array (1-d or 2-d) to sort.<br> 
                         Given that the rows are already sorted in the matrix, you should use 
                        concepts from mergesort. Otherwise there will be a small penalty of 20%.<br>
                        <br>
                        
                         Write a main function that does the following:<br>
                         Reads in the dimensions n and m of the matrix (n, m < 10) 
                        from the keyboard<br>
                         Opens the file named infile.txt to read it. If the file with that 
                        name does not exist (fopen() call returns error), your program 
                        should give an error message and exit<br>
                         Reads in the matrix elements from the file<br>
                         Calls SortMatrix() to sort the matrix as described<br>
                         Opens a file named outfile.txt for write<br>
                         Write the sorted matrix elements in the file outfile.txt<br>
                         Closes both infile.txt and outfile.txt with fclose() calls<br>

                    <p>Consider a set of students. Each student’s data is 
                        maintained in a structure called STUDENT which has the 
                        following fields: <br>(i) first name (string with max 20 
                        characters), <br>(ii) last name (string with max 20 
                        characters), <br>(iii) roll no. (string with max 10 characters), 
                        (iv) department code (string with max 5 characters), and <br>
                        (v) CGPA (float)<br>
                         Define the STUDENT structure as above<br>
                        <br>
                         Write a function<br>
                        void SortStudents(struct STUDENT S[ ], int n)<br>
                        that takes an array S of STUDENT structures with n elements, and 
                        sorts it in ascending order (lexicographic) of first name<br>
                        • If there are two students with same first name, the one with 
                        the smaller (lexicographic) last name should come first. 
                        Assume that there are no two students with both same first 
                        name and same last name.<br>
                        • You can use string functions like strcmp() to decide if one string is 
                        smaller than the other or not<br>
                        • You can write any additional function if you want, but add a 
                        comment inside the function stating what that function does<br>
                        <br>
                         Write a function<br>
                        struct STUDENT *SearchStudents(struct STUDENT S[ ], int n, char *first, char *last)
                        that takes as parameters an array S of STUDENT structures with n
                        elements, already sorted by first name and last name as described 
                        in the SortStudents() function, pointers to null-terminated strings 
                        first and last, and returns the details of the student with the first 
                        name first and last name last. If there is no such student, the 
                        functions should return NULL. Assume that there are no two 
                        student with both same first name and same last name<br>
                        • If a matched student is found, malloc a STUDENT structure 
                        inside the function, copy the student’s data in that structure, and 
                        return the pointer to it, and assign it to a pointer in the main 
                        function appropriately. Do not return the address of a local 
                        struct STUDENT variable declared inside the function.<br>
                        • For full marks, you should use concepts of binary search to 
                        search, as the array given is sorted. You can write either 
                        recursive or non-recursive version of binary search. Otherwise 
                        there will be a small 20% penalty.<br>
                        <br>
                        • Write a main function that does the following:<br>
                        • Reads in a filename (a string with max 20 characters) from the 
                        keyboard in a character array f.<br>
                        • Opens the file specified by the string f for read. If the file does not 
                        exist, print an error message and exit<br>
                        • Reads in the student details from the file f in an array of 
                        STUDENT records<br>
                        • Note that the no. of student records is not known to you at 
                        first. So do exactly the following.<br>
                        • First read all the data one by one in a single STUDENT 
                        structure (overwrite on the same structure) till the EOF is 
                        reached. Count how many structures you read before the 
                        EOF is hit. This is the no. of structures n in the file<br>
                        • Close the file f (fclose())<br>
                        • Malloc an array X of STUDENT structures of size n.<br> 
                        • Now open the file again with fopen(), and read n
                        structures from it in the array of STUDENT structures 
                        created<br>• Malloc one more array of student structures A of size n<br>
                        • Copy X to A (so now you have the same student structures in two 
                        arrays, X and A)<br>
                        • Call SortStudents() with appropriate parameters to sort A by first 
                        name<br>
                        • In a loop, does the following<br>
                        • Reads in an integer k from the keyboard<br>
                        • If k = 0, exits the program<br>
                        • If k = 1, reads in a string x and a string y from the keyboard 
                        and calls SearchStudents() with appropriate parameters to 
                        search for student with first name x and last name y. It prints 
                        the field if a matching student is found, or prints an 
                        appropriate message<br>

                        Write another function to find its saddle point(s) and print on the terminal. <br>
                        If there is none, then print that message. <br>
                        (An element is a saddle point if it is the unique maximum (or minimum) in its row but the unique minimum (resp., maximum) in its 
                        column.) (100) <br>
                        <br>
                        Examples: <br>

                        7 3 4 <br>
                        <br>
                        In the above array a[1][1]= 2 is a saddle point. <br>
                        1 5 7 <br>

                        7 3 4 <br>
                        <br>
                        In the above array, there is no saddle point. (Because the maximum in the 2nd row is not unique.) <br>
                        <br>
                        5 1 4 <br>

                        8 3 9 <br>
                        <br>
                        In the above array, there are two saddle points: <br>
                        a[0][0]= 5 and a[2][1] = 3 <br>
