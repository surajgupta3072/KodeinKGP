                    <p>Take an integer array as input from the user. Write a recursive function to find the

                        of the array.<br> To solve this problem, you need to write 2 functions: Function-1 computes
                        the absolute difference between 2 numbers and return the same.<br> Function-2 is a
                        recursive function which computes the successive differences between the elements of
                        an array from beginning to end of an array. Function-2 uses the Function-1 for
                        calculating the difference between 2 numbers, and it should take only the integer array
                        and its size as input arguments.<br>

                        Output: The absolute difference of 5 and 6 is:1<br>
                        The absolute difference of 6 and 8 is:2<br>
                        The absolute difference of 8 and 12 is:4<br>
                        The absolute difference of 12 and 18 is:6</p>

                        Write a main function that <br>
                         reads in two strings in two character arrays A and B using 
                        the %s option in scanf. You can assume that the strings 
                        will have at most 100 characters. <br>
                         finds the length of the two strings.<br>
                         calls the IsPrefix() function to find if the string in A is a 
                        prefix of the string in B, and print a message appropriately.<br>
                         If the length of A is p1, and the length of B is p2, you will 
                        call IsPrefix() with the parameters (A, 0, p1 – 1, B, 0, p2 
                        – 1).<br>
                         All printings must be done from main, there should not be 
                        anything printed inside the function.<br>
                        <br>
                         Hint:<br>
                         First think of two complete strings and a recursive 
                        formulation to define when is one a prefix of another<br>
                         So if X =“khar”, and Y = “kharagpur”, for X to be a 
                        prefix of Y, note that first letter of both has to be same 
                        (‘k’) and the remaining part of X (“har”) has to be a 
                        prefix of the remaining part of Y (“haragpur”). Do you 
                        see the recursion now?<br>
                         Then just use the same idea, but on the substrings 
                        defined by the parameters<br>
                         Decide what parameters to pass in the recursive call<br>
                         Work with the above example to understand<br>
                         For recursive calls made, store the return value in a 
                        variable. Then think what to do with it</p>

                    <p>Consider a string of characters with no space 
                        between them (for example, a word in English), 
                        terminated by ‘\0’. You will write a C program to 
                        count and print the maximum consecutive
                        occurrence of the same character, and the 
                        corresponding character. If there are multiple 
                        characters that occur consecutively the same 
                        number of times, you can print any one such 
                        character.<br>
                         <br>For example,  If the string is “aabbbccbbd”, then ‘a’ occurs two times 
                        consecutively, ‘b’ occurs maximum of three times 
                        consecutively, ‘c’ occurs two times consecutively, and ‘d’ 
                        occurs one time consecutively. So you should output 
                        the character ‘b’ and 3, since ‘b’ occurs the maximum 
                        number of times consecutively among all characters<br><br>
                         If the string is “pdslab”, there is no character that occurs 
                        more than once consecutively. So in this case, you 
                        should output the character ‘p’ and 1 (meaning that p 
                        occurred the max times (=1) consecutively). Note that 
                        you can also output any of the other characters in the 
                        string (instead of ‘p’), as they all occur exactly once<br>
                        <br>
                         Write a C function int CountChar(char C[ ], char *mc) that 
                        takes a string C of characters (terminated by ‘\0’) and 
                        returns the count of the maximum number of consecutive 
                        occurrence of the same character. It also puts the 
                        character with this maximum in mc.<br>
                        <br>
                        Write a main function that does the following:<br>
                         Reads in an integer n<br>
                         Dynamically allocates a character array of size n<br>
                         Read in a string using %s in scanf (assume size of string will 
                        be < n)<br>
                         Call CountChar() to find the maximum number of 
                        consecutive occurrence of the same character in the string.<br>
                         Prints the maximum count and the character with the 
                        maximum count.<br>
                        <br>
                         If the string read is “aabbbccbbd”, your program should 
                        print<br>
                        The character with maximum consecutive occurrence is b,

                        <br>
                         If the string read is “aabbbccc”, your program should print 
                        either <br>
                        The character with maximum consecutive occurrence is b,

                        Or <br>
                        The character with maximum consecutive occurrence is c, 
                        with count 3

                        total price if tickets are available (you may call the checkAvailability function here). Ask
                        if the user wants to proceed. If the user agrees, print “Ticket booked”, reduce the number
                        of available tickets, and increase the revenue earned by the ticket purchase amount.<br>
                        <br>

                    <p>Implement the "stack storage" using structure. In the "stack storage", you can insert and remove elements from only one end of 
                        the stack, termed as stack 'top'.<br> The insertion of the element is called push and removal of the element is called pop. Hence, the 
                        element, that you have pushed last, can be removed (popped) first (Last In First Out).<br> Write a C program to perform (1 ) push,(2) 
                        pop and (3) top operations. You may take the option as the input from the user (as 1, 2 and 3) and perform the required 
                        operations. The stack size is also taken from the user as an input value.<br> Push will take the input from the user and insert the 
                        element in the stack.<br> Pop operation removes the element from the stack, also prints the removed element. In addition, 
                        implement the top operation just to display the top element of the stack.<br> If there is no element in the stack, the pop operation 
                        will return "Stack Underflow" and the top operation will return "No Data". If the stack size reaches the maximum limit, push 
                        operation will return "Stack Overflow". <br>You should implement suitable functions to implement push, pop etc operations. The 
                        stack structure should contain (a) an array to store the stack elements (b) stack top index. 
                        <br>
                        Example <br>
                        <br>
                        Enter Stack size n: 5 <br>
                        Press 1 -> Push, 2 -> Pop, 3-> Top <br>
                        Enter option: 3 <br>
                        No Data <br>
                        <br>
                        Press 1 -> Push, 2 -> Pop, 3-> Top <br>
                        Enter option: 2 <br>
                        Stack Underflow <br>
                        <br>
                        Press 1 -> Push, 2 -> Pop, 3-> Top <br>

                        Please remember, during enque(), the newly inserted element will be the rear element.<br> During deque(), the front element will be
